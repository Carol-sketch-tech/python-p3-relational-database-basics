RELATIONAL DATABASE STRUCTURE.
relational database have unique features that allows us to establish relationshipd between multiple thables.
Primary keys and foreign keys.
     primary keys -> a columns in a table with an identifier(id) that uniquely identifies one specifi record or row, in a table
     Foreign keys -> a column in one table that refers to a primry key in another table.
in relational datbse, wever row has a number called Primary key.
relationshipd between tables can be established by using a foreighn key column, like out manager ID columns that uses that primary key of another table to refer to an member if that table.
the process of using a key in one table to identify a corresponding rown in another table is what SQL will do for us 
programitcally when we give it the right instructions.
